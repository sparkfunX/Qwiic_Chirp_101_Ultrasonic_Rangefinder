The CH101 from TDK InvenSense is a ToF (time-of-flight) ultrasonic rangefinder with a range of 4 centimeters to 1.2 meters. What sets the CH101 apart from other ultrasonic sensors that we've seen in the past is that it's capable of ranging multiple objects within its field-of-view simultaneously. This is made possible by an integrated system-on-chip that crunches the numbers and then provides digital range readings via IÂ²C. 

Our Qwiic breakout provides voltage regulation and level shifting for the MOD-CH101 Evaluation Module. This module consists of the CH101 sensor attached to an omnidirectional acoustic housing assembly and is attached with a short flex cable for easy mounting. There is not yet an Arduino compatible library for this sensor, however there is an API and extensive documentation available from TDK.
